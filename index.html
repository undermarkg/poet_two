                            In the interests of all who will appreciate it and for the good of prosperity this work is presented.
                            The poems in the book capture the essence and spirit of the poet's writings however they are imperfect for they are not exact copies of the poems but preserved by the minds of others. Thus if there is an error in grammar it should
                            be forgiven. One should also keep in mind that the original poems where of a more profound and elegant nature in there original splendor.

                        <p>Considered by José Alfonso Mendonça Azevedo "our Verlaine", Edgar Mata (1878-1907) was, along with Alphonsus
                            de
                            Guimaraens, the highlight of the Symbolist movement in Minas Gerais. The poet, who was born in Ouro Preto,
                            had
                            in his poetry the constant presence of the "solitude of the deserts" of Minas Gerais and the "prolonged
                            sunsets"
                            of the region, as well as the poet of Ismália. Cruz e Sousa's influence is constantly present - as it was in
                            all
                            our Symbolism - but not withdrawing, as Andrade Muricy exemplified in his Panorama of the Brazilian
                            Symbolist
                            Movement, the character "of a true poet, with a defined personality".</p>

                        <p>As a public figure, he collaborated with the magazine Lótus and the São Paulo newspaper Jornal do Comércio.
                            He
                            participated in the literary group "Jardineiros do Ideal", whose importance in the state of Minas Gerais was
                            significant, and this value was recognized by Nestor Vítor - Cruz e Sousa's closest friend - when, in 1900,
                            Nestor called the group to give a lecture on the most significant poet of our Symbolism.</p>

                        <p>About the incident that put an end to a large part of Edgar Mata's work
                            and
                            which I referred to at the beginning of this topic, Cilene Cunha de Souza tells us a definitive testimony
                            about
                            the case: "On August 7, 1921, in the Jornal Minas Gerais, Mario de Lima wrote:
                            'What Edgard Mata published constitutes the smallest fraction of his work. Much of this has unfortunately
                            been
                            lost. Lost - inadvertently thrown by a venerable lady of the poet's family - in the flames of a stove,
                            dozens of
                            precious originals of his verses, almost all unpublished, as he once told me, nonchalantly, as if it were
                            the
                            most natural thing in the world.</p>

                        <p>Despite the scarcity of his work, his name reached the top echelon of the Modernist movement, being admired,
                            among others, by Manuel Bandeira and by the Minas Gerais native Carlos Drummond de Andrade (in Panorama of
                            the
                            Symbolist Movement). Poems like "Stalactite" and "I remember this mysterious sunset..." profoundly marked
                            generations of readers, even with the publication limited to panoramas and collections on the Symbolist
                            movement. On the occasion of his death, he was honored by Mariana Higina with the sonnet "Saudade" - an
                            affectionate reminder of the poet's painful and beautiful "Stalactite". He was saved by the oral tradition
                            that
                            existed in Minas Gerais, because his poems passed from mouth to mouth through declamation; without such a
                            tradition, it is very likely that the codices would not be enough for the memory of Edgar Mata, even if only
                            clumsy, to still have a shine.</p>

                        <p>

                            The poet about whom our recognition still needs to be greater and
                            better
                            refined - since the period in which he wrote and in which his poetry still lived fully (between 1896-1920)
                            still
                            seems to us as a missing link in our Literature, such a focus given to the Week of Modern Art and its
                            artists.
                            Notice how sparse Edgar Mata's punctuation is (what remains of his work was transcribed by the poet's
                            sisters.
                            It is not known whether they have preserved the original punctuation of the text in its entirety or whether
                            the
                            text found in the codices is full of grammatical typos; On the veracity or otherwise of this characteristic
                            of
                            Edgar Mata's poetry, a relative of the poet - and also a bard - wrote, in 1916, that "these poems of his
                            (...),
                            as can be seen, are not well punctuated. Edgar always used a very simple punctuation, but not as scarce as
                            this
                            one"); in the Panorama of the Brazilian Symbolist Movement, Andrade Muricy even included some semicolons in
                            the
                            text in order to arrive at a thematic and textual pattern.</p>

                    just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit
                    overflow.
